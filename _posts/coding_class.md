# Coding Class

The goal of this class was to teach useful topics on coding and electronics in an engaging way that middle schoolers can understand. I designed the curriculum using relatable concepts (such as explaining object-oriented programming with Minecraft). I also incorporated fun activities and activities based on topics they were learning in other classes (such as distance formula in algebra)
