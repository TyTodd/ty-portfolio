# Dimension 3D

Dimension is a 3-dimensional board game I started development on in summer 2022. The game is played on a 2x2x2 grid of squares where players can place right-triangular prism blocks. In the game two players are given 2 different cards at random with a 2x2 grid consisting of a pattern of right triangles and squares. The goal is to get the 2-dimensional projection of your side of the board to look like your card.
The rules are as follows.

- You may add a new block to the board if there is space
- You may move any block on the board as long as it wasn't the block that was moved during the last turn
- Players are allowed to see their opponents card throughout the entirety of the game.

## Future Features

Dimension is still in development and I'd like to get it hosted on a website at some point. Before that happens I have to implement these features:

- general bug fixes
- AI gameplay
- Multiplayer online gameplay
- leaderboards
