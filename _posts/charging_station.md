# Charging Station Project

The charging station project is an idea I came up with in late 2019. After winning a $1700 grant, I designed and built the project over a year. The charging station has eight individual cells enclosed by plexiglass doors. The doors are locked and unlocked by solenoids controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer. The computer also controls the touchscreen user interface that prompts users to select a door and enter a pin. Additionally, the computer controls the LED lights, which are pulsing red when a cell is occupied and static green when a cell is open to use.
